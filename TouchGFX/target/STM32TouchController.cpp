            Often the sw requires ISRs (interrupt service routines) to be quick while communication
            with I2C can be considered relatively long (depending on SW requirements).
            Considering that the TS feature don't need immediate reaction,

            in order to avoid blocking I2C communication on interrupt service routines */

            Mcu communicates with TS only when the flag has been set by ISR. This is just an example:
